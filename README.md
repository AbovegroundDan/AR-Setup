# AR Setup tutorial

A simple first tutorial for getting an ARKit scene up and running with SceneKit. 

Shows scene initialization, with some placeholders for the future, how to create an object and add it to the scene when you tap. It adds the object at a plane in front of the camera translated by your touch point.

In this example, I make use of some utility functions that Apple provides in their object placement demo.
